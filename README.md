# FIRE DETECTION AND ILLEGAL ACTION SOUNDS DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING IN DEEP FOREST
<br />

#### This project can be used to detect fire occurance in deep forest through computer vision and detects chainsaw sounds which are illegal felling in the deep forest using deep learning.

# Setup 

      Once you downloaded the model from the gdriver , Place the model folder inside our teamstartup folder.
      Please make sure you have Anaconda3 setup in your computer to have conda environment 

# COMMANDS
     
     1. Open anaconda3 powershell
     2. Navigate to the folder (teamStartup)
     3. conda create --name your_environment_name
     4. conda activate your_environment_name
     5. conda install pip
     6. pip install -r requirements.txt
     7. pip install pipwin
     8. pipwin install pyaudio

# Run 

      Once you activated and installed all the packages in the environment its time to start.

      RUN : python.exe team_startup.py 

Running the experiment or detection requires that you have 
Tensorflow, OpenCV and PyAudio installed.
